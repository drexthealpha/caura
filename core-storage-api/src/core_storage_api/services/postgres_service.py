    ``ts_rank_cd(search_vector, plainto_tsquery(...))`` expression itself, and
    SQLAlchemy inlines an expression at every site that names it, so writing it
    twice makes Postgres evaluate the ranking function twice. The
    algebraically identical

        x / (1 + x)  ==  1 - 1/(1 + x)

    names ``x`` once, halving the renders contributed by this factor.

    WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT BUY. Compiling the real ``memory_scored_search``
    statement, ``ts_rank_cd(`` goes from **18 renders to 9** (and
    ``plainto_tsquery(`` 27 -> 18). NOT to 1: ``similarity`` names ``fts_score``
    in both branches of its CASE, ``score`` inlines ``similarity``, and both are
    output columns of the scored CTE — so four live references remain, times the
    UNION'd reserved branch. Getting to 1 means projecting ``similarity`` and
    ``vec_sim`` once in an inner derived table and computing ``score`` over
    that; it also needs a real optimisation barrier, because with references
    still live Postgres flattens a plain subquery and re-substitutes. That is a
    separate change to the hot path, with its own plan-shape review.

    Measured in isolation on a 31,446-memory corpus with genuine multi-term
    matches (scoring 2 renders vs 1, ordered and limited): **32-39% faster**
    across queries matching 1,875-11,505 rows — 92.0ms -> 56.4ms at 11,505,
    medians of 7 runs. Read that as the gain on the FTS scoring component
    alone; the full search also pays six pgvector distance computations per
    row, so end-to-end it is smaller.

    NOT bit-identical, and the difference is real but negligible: the two forms
    disagree by at most one ULP (measured max ``|a - b|`` = 5.55e-17 over every
    matching row of that corpus). That is ~4 orders of magnitude below the
    tightest tolerance anything here asserts (1e-12) and far below any score

    Which matters because of what the answer costs. A batch whose rows disagree
    fails identically on every attempt, so any answer that invites a retry
    invites an infinite one — core-api's bulk route maps storage 5xx to "504,

    answer permanent instead.

    Inherits ``fields`` from the shared base rather than redeclaring

    reach the wire as data. Writing that ``__init__`` out a second time here

        Joins through Entity.canonical_name to find overlap. When fleet_id is

        scopes candidates to the writer's visibility tier so a scope_org
        write can't be linked into a scope_team chain (and vice versa).

        ``include_supersedes`` (A4 #11): when True, also return the
        ``conflicted`` row that ``memory_id``'s chain points at — i.e.
        the candidate Path A retracted FOR this memory. Path C uses
        this to re-judge Path A's verdict (A4 #13).

        Filter direction: a row M is included via this branch iff
        ``M.status == 'conflicted'`` AND
        ``memory_id``'s ``supersedes_id`` field equals ``M.id``. This
        matches Path A's chain shape — the *newer/active* row carries
        ``supersedes_id`` pointing back at the *older/conflicted* row;
        the conflicted row itself has ``supersedes_id=NULL``.

        The original A4 #11 (PR #185) used ``Memory.supersedes_id ==
        memory_id`` instead, which was structurally inverted — it
        looked for "conflicted rows pointing at me" but Path A leaves
        the conflicted row's ``supersedes_id`` as NULL. That filter
        matched zero production rows. See
        ``flow-debug-contradiction-chain-shape`` memory for the
        investigation that surfaced it.

        Default ``False`` preserves the back-compat behaviour for every
        existing caller.

        Returns ``False`` when the memory is not in ``tenant_id`` or any named
        entity is not, having written nothing; ``True`` when the links are in.

        ``memory_entity_links`` has no ``tenant_id`` of its own, so the join row
        cannot carry a predicate — but both parents do (``Memory.tenant_id``,
        ``Entity.tenant_id``), which is what makes an existence check sufficient
        and a schema change unnecessary.

        **Both sides are load-bearing and neither implies the other.** Checking
        only the memory lets a caller staple a foreign entity onto their own
        memory, pulling another tenant's graph node into their namespace;
        checking only the entities lets them staple their own entity onto a
        foreign memory. The two failures are independent, so the checks are too.

        One ``False`` for "no such memory", "not your memory" and "not your
        entity" alike: distinguishing them would answer as an existence oracle
        for memory and entity UUIDs, which is the thing a service that
        authenticates nothing (GHSA-wgvw-28pq-jc36) must not do.

        The check and the insert share a session and neither parent's
        ``tenant_id`` is caller-writable — ``_ENTITY_UPDATABLE_FIELDS`` omits it
        on entities (#1081) and ``_MEMORY_IMMUTABLE_FIELDS`` names it on
        memories (#1118) — so a row cannot change hands between the two.

        Shares ``_owned_link_endpoints`` with the two ``POST /entities/links``
        paths (#1124), so all three writers to this join table resolve ownership
        the same way and a fix to one cannot miss the others.

        conservative normalised match (WT-2 — case/whitespace and a small

        Phase 2 embedding cosine similarity (top-N by distance, first ≥

        Phase 1 is a single batched SELECT keyed by row tuple; Phases 1.5

        same session.

    # matches ``memory_find_successors``); the supersede/restore UPDATEs use
    # raw ``text()`` with ``ANY(CAST(:ids AS uuid[]))`` where it's natural.

        Routine operations on a busy fleet repeat the same episode title
        hundreds of times per window (heartbeats, polling loops, bastion
        sessions...). Feeding every instance to the insights LLM makes the
        sample one giant echo — measured on the eToro fleet, "newest 200"
        spanned under a day and ~1/3 of insight citations were repetition
        noise. Collapsing to the NEWEST row per title keeps every distinct
        activity discoverable while the ``dup_count`` / ``first_seen`` window

        Deliberately NOT used by contradictions/divergence: same-titled rows
        that disagree are precisely the evidence those modes exist to find.

        Correctness notes:
        - NULL/empty titles must not collapse into one exemplar — the dedup
          key falls back to the row id, so untitled rows all survive.
        - ``dup_count``/``first_seen`` are computed over the FILTERED set
          (the window functions run after ``filters``), so the annotation
          means "N matching rows in this window", not "N rows ever".
        - Exemplar choice is newest-by-created_at (id-desc tiebreak for
          determinism); the caller's ``order_by`` is applied AFTER the join,
          so each mode keeps its own result ordering. ``order_by`` may be a
          callable receiving the inner subquery, for modes whose ordering
          needs the window annotations themselves (failures sorts by
          ``inner.c.dup_count`` so high-frequency patterns aren't cut by
