"""Tests for fast-mode post-write governance remediation (eToro).

The fast-mode counterpart to ``GovernanceDecision``: in the default fast mode
enrichment is deferred to the worker, which PATCHes the LLM's ``contains_pii`` /
``business_relevance`` onto the already-persisted row; the enriched-event
consumer then calls ``remediate_after_enrichment`` to apply the tenant's
configured action on that free-form signal. Storage + audit are stubbed so
these stay deterministic (no async audit queue / storage round-trip).

# drop — "a policy that could not be applied must not be followed by rows it
# might have forbidden". Auto-chunk children get no such protection on a
# deferred deployment. There the write-time ``GovernanceDecision`` runs with
# ``enrichment=None``, takes its uncertain branch and enforces NOTHING, and the
# children are built and committed immediately. The parent's real verdict
# arrives minutes later, through here — and remediated only the row the event
# named. ``parent_memory_id`` was written on every child and queried nowhere.
#
# So a tenant configured ``non_business.disposition=drop`` had its parent
# dropped and audited while N children carrying the same content stayed live at
# ``scope_team``, with no governance metadata and no audit row tying them to the
# drop. Permanently: children are never enriched, so no later pass revisits them.
