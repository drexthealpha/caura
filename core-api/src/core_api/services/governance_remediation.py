"""Fast-mode post-write governance remediation.

In fast mode (the default) enrichment is deferred to core-worker, which PATCHes
the LLM's ``contains_pii`` / ``business_relevance`` onto the already-persisted
row. The ``memclaw.memory.enriched`` consumer then calls
:func:`remediate_after_enrichment` to apply the tenant's configured action on
that free-form signal — the fast-mode counterpart to the synchronous
``GovernanceDecision`` step (strong mode).

The DETERMINISTIC pattern gate already ran synchronously pre-write
(``GovernanceScanContent``), so regex/Luhn/entropy-detectable PII/PCI/secrets
were never persisted in either mode; only the LLM's free-form judgement is
eventually-consistent here (≈ enrichment-deferral latency).

    ``_enrich_memory_background`` and runs remediation *before* it fans out, so
    a drop stops it and a downgrade is carried onto the children it does create.
    Auto-chunk is the path with no such ordering: on a deferred deployment the
    write-time ``GovernanceDecision`` sees ``enrichment=None``, takes its
    documented uncertain branch and enforces nothing, and the children are
    committed immediately. The verdict arrives here minutes later, naming only
    the parent.

    Gated on ``auto_chunked`` rather than querying unconditionally. The lookup
    filters on a JSON key with no supporting index, and a tenant configured
    ``drop`` remediates constantly — so an ungated query would tax every
    ordinary drop to serve the rare chunked one. The marker is safe to gate on
    because it is stamped on the parent unconditionally, in the same function
    that builds the children, and it is already present on the production rows
    this fix has to reach — a NEW marker would only ever appear on rows written
    after the deploy, leaving the existing leak in place.
