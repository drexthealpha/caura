"""Pub/Sub consumer for core-api.

Subscribes core-api to two back-channels published by core-worker
after the async write path lands a memory row:

* ``Topics.Memory.ENRICHED`` (CAURA-595) — fired after a successful
  enrichment PATCH.
* ``Topics.Memory.EMBEDDED`` (loadtest-7 fix) — fired after a
  successful embedding PATCH.

Both consumers run :func:`detect_contradictions_async`. Two events
trigger the detector because either the embed or the enrich worker
can land first, and the detector needs both fields available; whichever
event arrives second sees the other side present and runs detection.
The detector is idempotent under repeated calls on the same row, so
the rare case where both events trigger detection back-to-back doesn't
double-write contradiction rows.

Atomic-fact fan-out (parent → child memories) is intentionally not
handled here. The worker drops ``EnrichmentResult.atomic_facts``
entirely (see ``_ENRICHMENT_UNROUTED_FIELDS`` in
``core-worker/src/core_worker/consumer.py``), so they never reach
storage. Persisting them at the worker side and fanning out from a
storage fetch is a separate piece of work.
